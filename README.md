### Cat_Filter
##### Building+your+Deep+Neural+Network+-+Step+by+Step+v8 contains helper functions which are called in Cat_vs_NonCats for model implementation
The Cat_Filter project has been implemented using Jupyter notebook.
The basic aim of the project is to compare the accuracy of a shallow(2-Layered) Neural Network with
Deep Neural Network(4-Layered) on test-data.
Python Libraries are used in the implementation.
